QUESTION 1
Dimention Reduction
This is the process of reducing the number of input variables(dimensions) of a dataset in order to make ML algorithms more efficient.
The more the number of dimensions, the harder it is to perform machine learning. This is called the curse of dimensionality.

QUESTION 2
Identifying and deleting duplicates

import pandas as pd

#load and display data
data = pd.read_csv('file.csv')
data

#find and display duplicates except first occurence
duplicates = data[data.duplicated()]
duplicates

# delete duplicates
data.drop_duplicates()
